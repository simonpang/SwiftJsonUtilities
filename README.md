# SwiftJsonUtilities

A Swift library to make JSON parsing in Swift language as simple as possible. 

Swift is strict with type checking, making parsing JSON objects difficult. Here's a [blog post](http://owensd.io/2014/06/18/json-parsing.html) written by David.

This project aims to remove most of the complexity of JSON handling in Swift by using DSL style syntax.
